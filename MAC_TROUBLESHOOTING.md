# JIRA Spike: Lambda Local Development Feasibility (Mac Only)

## Epic: Local Lambda Development and Testing Infrastructure

### Ticket: LAMBDA-SPIKE-001
**Title:** Spike: Evaluate Feasibility of Local Lambda Development Environment (Mac)

**Type:** Spike  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Labels:** spike, lambda, localstack, docker, mac, feasibility

---

## Description
Investigate and prototype a local development environment for Go Lambda functions on Mac to determine if it's feasible to support both local HTTP server and LocalStack integration. Focus on Mac-specific optimizations and reliability.

---

## Spike Objective
**Goal:** Determine if we can build a reliable local Lambda development environment on Mac that works consistently for the development team.

**Success Criteria:** Working prototype that demonstrates core functionality and identifies Mac-specific technical challenges.
