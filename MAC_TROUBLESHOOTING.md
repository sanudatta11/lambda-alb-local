# JIRA Spike: Lambda Local Development Feasibility

## Epic: Local Lambda Development and Testing Infrastructure

### Ticket: LAMBDA-SPIKE-001
**Title:** Spike: Evaluate Feasibility of Local Lambda Development Environment

**Type:** Spike  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Labels:** spike, lambda, localstack, docker, mac, feasibility

---

## Description
Investigate and prototype a local development environment for Go Lambda functions to determine if it's feasible to support both local HTTP server and LocalStack integration across different operating systems (Mac, Linux, Windows).

---

## Spike Objective
**Goal:** Determine if we can build a reliable, cross-platform local Lambda development environment that works consistently for the development team.

**Success Criteria:** Working prototype that demonstrates core functionality and identifies key technical challenges.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### ðŸŽ¯ **AC-1: Core Functionality Proof of Concept**
**Objective:** Prove that basic Lambda function can run locally

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **AC-1.1:** Go Lambda function builds and runs as local HTTP server
- [ ] **AC-1.2:** Function handles basic HTTP requests (GET, POST)
- [ ] **AC-1.3:** Returns JSON responses with request details
- [ ] **AC-1.4:** Works on at least one OS (Mac/Linux/Windows)

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Local server starts and responds to requests
- [ ] JSON responses are properly formatted
- [ ] Basic error handling works
- [ ] Can start with single command

---

### ðŸŽ¯ **AC-2: LocalStack Integration Feasibility**
**Objective:** Determine if LocalStack can reliably run Lambda functions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **AC-2.1:** LocalStack starts successfully on target OS
- [ ] **AC-2.2:** Lambda function deploys to LocalStack
- [ ] **AC-2.3:** Function can be invoked and returns responses
- [ ] **AC-2.4:** Identifies OS-specific challenges and solutions

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] LocalStack deployment works
- [ ] Lambda function executes in container
- [ ] Key technical challenges are documented
- [ ] Feasibility assessment is clear

---

### ðŸŽ¯ **AC-3: Cross-Platform Compatibility Assessment**
**Objective:** Evaluate platform-specific issues and solutions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **AC-3.1:** Tests on Mac (Intel/Apple Silicon)
- [ ] **AC-3.2:** Tests on Linux (Ubuntu)
- [ ] **AC-3.3:** Identifies platform-specific requirements
- [ ] **AC-3.4:** Documents workarounds for known issues

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Platform-specific issues are identified
- [ ] Solutions/workarounds are documented
- [ ] Compatibility matrix is created
- [ ] Risk assessment is complete

---

## Technical Investigation Areas

### **TI-1: Build System Compatibility**
- [ ] Go cross-compilation for different OS/architectures
- [ ] Docker container execution on different platforms
- [ ] Binary compatibility between host and container

### **TI-2: LocalStack Reliability**
- [ ] LocalStack startup consistency across platforms
- [ ] Lambda function deployment success rates
- [ ] Container networking issues and solutions
- [ ] Resource usage patterns

### **TI-3: Development Experience**
- [ ] Setup complexity for new developers
- [ ] Error handling and debugging capabilities
- [ ] Performance characteristics
- [ ] Integration with existing workflows

---

## Deliverables

### **D1: Working Prototype**
- [ ] Basic local HTTP server implementation
- [ ] LocalStack integration proof of concept
- [ ] Simple command-line interface

### **D2: Technical Assessment Report**
- [ ] Platform compatibility matrix
- [ ] Known issues and workarounds
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Resource requirements

### **D3: Feasibility Recommendation**
- [ ] Go/No-Go decision with rationale
- [ ] Risk assessment
- [ ] Estimated effort for full implementation
- [ ] Alternative approaches considered

---

## Definition of Done (Spike)

### **Functional Requirements**
- [ ] Core functionality is demonstrated
- [ ] Key technical challenges are identified
- [ ] Platform compatibility is assessed

### **Technical Requirements**
- [ ] Prototype code is functional
- [ ] Technical documentation is complete
- [ ] Assessment report is comprehensive

### **Quality Requirements**
- [ ] Findings are evidence-based
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable
- [ ] Risks are properly identified

---

## Time Box
**Duration:** 3 story points (approximately 1-2 days)

**Time Allocation:**
- **Day 1:** Core functionality and LocalStack integration
- **Day 2:** Cross-platform testing and documentation

---

## Dependencies
- Docker Desktop
- Go development environment
- AWS CLI
- Access to Mac and Linux environments

---

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Prototype demonstrates core functionality
- [ ] Technical challenges are clearly identified
- [ ] Feasibility assessment is conclusive
- [ ] Recommendation is actionable

---

## Notes
- Focus on proving core concepts, not building production-ready solution
- Document all technical challenges encountered
- Be honest about limitations and risks
- Provide clear go/no-go recommendation with rationale
