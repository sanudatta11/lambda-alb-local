# JIRA Spike: Lambda Local Development (Mac)

## Ticket: LAMBDA-SPIKE-001
**Title:** Evaluate Local Lambda Development Environment on Mac

**Type:** Spike  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Labels:** spike, lambda, localstack, docker, mac

---

## Goal
Investigate feasibility of running Go Lambda functions locally on Mac using:
1. Local HTTP server (direct execution)
2. LocalStack (containerized execution)

Determine if we can build a reliable development environment for Mac-based teams.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### **AC-1: Local HTTP Server Implementation**
- [ ] Go Lambda function builds for Mac architecture (Intel/ARM64)
- [ ] HTTP server handles GET/POST requests with JSON responses
- [ ] CORS headers and error handling implemented
- [ ] Single command startup: `./start.sh deploy-simple`

### **AC-2: LocalStack Integration**
- [ ] LocalStack starts successfully on Mac with Docker
- [ ] Lambda function builds for Linux (container execution)
- [ ] Function deploys to LocalStack without "failed state"
- [ ] Lambda invocation returns expected JSON responses

### **AC-3: Mac-Specific Technical Assessment**
- [ ] Test on Intel Mac (x86_64)
- [ ] Test on Apple Silicon Mac (ARM64)
- [ ] Document Mac-specific Docker networking issues
- [ ] Identify performance characteristics and resource usage

---

## Technical Investigation

### **Build System Compatibility**
- Go cross-compilation: `GOOS=darwin` for local, `GOOS=linux` for containers
- Binary compatibility between Mac host and Linux containers
- Docker networking: `host.docker.internal` gateway configuration

### **LocalStack Reliability**
- Container startup consistency on Mac
- Lambda function deployment success rates
- Mac-specific Docker socket permissions and resource limits
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

### **Development Experience**
- Setup complexity and prerequisites
- Error messages and debugging capabilities
- Performance benchmarks (startup time, memory usage)
- Integration with existing Mac development workflows

---

## Deliverables

### **D1: Working Prototype**
- Functional local HTTP server implementation
- LocalStack integration with Lambda deployment
- Basic command-line interface for both approaches

### **D2: Technical Assessment Report**
- Platform compatibility matrix (Intel vs Apple Silicon)
- Known issues and workarounds for Mac
- Performance benchmarks and resource requirements
- Risk assessment and technical challenges

### **D3: Feasibility Recommendation**
- Go/No-Go decision with technical rationale
- Estimated effort for production implementation
- Alternative approaches if LocalStack fails

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Both local server and LocalStack approaches work
- [ ] Mac-specific technical challenges are identified
- [ ] Performance meets development team requirements

### **Technical Requirements**
- [ ] Prototype demonstrates core functionality
